# LILAC: Log Parsing using LLMs with Adaptive Parsing Cache

This is the replication package for [FSE24] ["LILAC: Log Parsing using LLMs with Adaptive Parsing Cache"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01796).

In this paper, we propose LILAC, the first practical LLM-based log parsing framework.
LILAC consists of two main components: the ICL-enhanced Parser and the adaptive parsing cache.

The detailed parsing time can be found in [detailed parsing time for RQ4](figures/parsing_time.png).

## Quick Start

### Datasets

Please first download the large-scale datasets for log parsing in LogPub from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8275861) and unzip these datasets into the directory of `full_dataset`.

###  Installation

1. Install ```python >= 3.8```
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


### Execution

- Candidate Sampling (optional)

    We have provided the saved sampled candidate logs for reproducing.

    One can also delete the `full_dataset/sampled_examples` and execute the LILAC's sampling algorithm as follows:

    ```bash
    cd sampling/
    python LILAC_sampling.py
    ```

- Online Log Parsing

    Please create a .env file in the root directory and insert 3 key-value pairs:
    - OPENAI_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    - OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-" (OpenAI API key (`sk-xxxx`))
    - GEMINI_API_KEY="gemini_key_here"

    We provide a one-click script to run LILAC for online log parsing.

    ```bash
    ./online_parsing.sh
    ```

    One can also go to `benchmark/evaluation` and execute:

    ```bash
    python LILAC_eval.py --shot [candidates] --example_size [demonstrations] --model [model]
    ```

The parsed results and evaluation results will be saved in the `result/` directory.

We have provided the saved evaluation metric files of LILAC with different settings in the directory of `result/`.
